  Building MoMoCharges, an Ionic Angular PWA to Aid in Calculating Mobile Money
  Transaction Charges

So I've decided to build an application to help in calculating Mobile Money transaction charges. So rather than checking online (or at the Kiosk) for transaction costs when I want to send some money, i'll simply pull out my phone, select the provider, enter the amount, and voila, the app calculates and displays the charges for both the sender and receiver.

If you are not yet aware of the huge impact Mobile Money is making on the African continent (or haven't heard of it before.. really? lol), you can check out [this articles](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tobyshapshak/2018/11/27/how-mobile-money-continues-to-boom-in-africa/#6f98e5ab205c) on Forbes.

So first things first, let setup the Ionic PWA application.
