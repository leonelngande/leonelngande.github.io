To enable adb debug on MTN Smart T running KaiOS, dial this code to open a menu and from there enable the USB debugging:

`*#*#0574#*#*`

I've been trying to develop an app for KaiOS and it's been a pain given MTN's Smart T is a locked device. After a while searching the internet, I came across [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiOS/comments/elfwei/i_cant_find_the_developer_options_on_my_kaios/fdo0wah?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) explaining it's possible to jailbreak the device. Upon googling omnisd, I came across the above jailbreak link which thankfully had the code to open a menu from where USB debugging can be enabled. Even though this fixed my initial problem, I think i'll go ahead and unlock my device.
