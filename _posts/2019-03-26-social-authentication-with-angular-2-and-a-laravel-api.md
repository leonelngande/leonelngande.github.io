Describe flow as here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52193882/facebook-socialite-get-user-from-token-and-secret>



Can use Nebular Auth module or other angular social package, maybe provide manual option?



Do proper flow with code examples from angular frontend to laravel api + how to do the routes and everything..
