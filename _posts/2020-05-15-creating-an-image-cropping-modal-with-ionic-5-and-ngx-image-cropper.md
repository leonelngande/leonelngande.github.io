## Introduction

Say you're creating a signup screen for an Ionic Angular app and it's required the user be able to upload and crop a profile image, how do you go about this? We'll cover such a use case in this post.

You should note Ionic 5 brings full support for Ivy, Angularâ€™s new renderer. Ivy enables apps to only require pieces of the renderer that they actually need, instead of the whole thing. This means that our final output will be smaller, which is better for load performance. Read more [here](https://ionicframework.com/blog/angular-9-0-0-and-ivy-improvements/).

Building with Ivy will equally allow us create components without necessarily adding them to a module, and the ability to lazy load them.
