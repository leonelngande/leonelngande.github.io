Hi, am Leonel, Ailurophile (üò∏ üêà) and Angular Developer in Silicon Mountain, Buea.

When not building web applications and services for my clients, I put time into building and improving [Xamcademy](https://xamcademy.com), my attempt at helping students better revise for exams.

Feedback is welcome! It's still in active development.
I also write on my experiences working with Angular and as a developer here.

Want to get in touch or have a project you'd like to discuss? Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leonelngande), [LinkedIn](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01b729f550597fbf1c/), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01b729f550597fbf1c/), or by filling out the form below.
