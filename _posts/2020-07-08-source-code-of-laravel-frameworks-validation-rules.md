If you'd like to view the source code of Laravel's validation rules on Github, have a look here [laravel/framework/blob/5.3/src/Illuminate/Validation/Validator.php#L1102](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/5.3/src/Illuminate/Validation/Validator.php#L1102).

After a long search through the Laravel Github repositories, I finally had a break and found the link through [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40434920/6924437) Stackoverflow answer. I wanted to see how the framework *actually* validates integers.
