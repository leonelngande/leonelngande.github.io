You can use one of the below approaches:
1. Use the Octopress plugin as described in this [Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26984228/6924437).
2. Use the approach in [this pull request](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/pull/359/commits/729a0ed0eaa70d00f9e3fe3db85efbf64a037768#diff-ded1f8f5da9ce9a5f5c261a95c9b199fR3) to the Jekyll So Simple Theme. You may have to update the code to match your video storage path.

If you know of any other approach, please leave a comment. Preferably not a plugin.
