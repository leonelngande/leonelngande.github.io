Hey! Am Leonel, a cat lover üêà and Cameroon üá®üá≤ based freelance Web Developer.

I currently focus on helping businesses build cross-platform web and mobile applications, leveraging a single codebase and web technologies to deploy to the app stores, cutting down time and costs.

I enjoy working with Angular, Ionic, the Google Maps Javascript API, Mapbox, Firebase, PWAs, RxJS, and Typescript. 

When not doing client work, I put time into building and improving [fun projects](/work/)! Like [Switchn](https://switchn.net), a platform which enables you to buy airtime for CAMTEL, Orange Cameroon, NEXTTEL, and MTN Cameroon, using your preferred payment method (MTN Mobile Money or Orange Money).

Feedback is welcome! It's built for use in Cameroon only. 

I also enjoy sharing my experience working with Angular and as a Web Developer, primarily through blog posts.

Want to say hello or have a project you'd like to discuss? Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leonelngande), [LinkedIn](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01b729f550597fbf1c/), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01b729f550597fbf1c/), or by filling out the form below üëá.
