Hey! Am Leonel, a cat lover üêà and freelance Web Developer.

I currently focus on helping small and medium sized businesses fully leverage the Angular platform in driving business value through web and mobile applications.

I enjoy working with Angular, Ionic, the Google Maps Javascript API, Firebase, PWAs, RxJS, and Typescript. 

When not doing client work, I put time into building and improving [fun projects](/work/)! Like [Xamcademy](https://xamcademy.com), my attempt at helping students better revise for examinations.

Feedback is welcome! It's still in active development. 

I also enjoy sharing my experience working with Angular and as a web developer, primarily through blog posts.

Want to say hello or have a project you'd like to discuss? Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/leonelngande), [LinkedIn](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01b729f550597fbf1c/), [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01b729f550597fbf1c/), or by filling out the form below üëá.
